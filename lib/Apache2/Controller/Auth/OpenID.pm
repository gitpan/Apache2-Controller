=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implements an authentication mechanism for L<Apache2::Controller>
that uses OpenID.  

This is NOT an AuthenPerlHandler.  This is an implementation
of a simple cookie-based mechanism that shows the browser
a login page, where your controller should present and process an
HTML form for logging in.  

If you want an authentication handler that uses browser-based auth
(the pop-up dialog implemented by HTTP auth protocol) use 
L<Apache::Authen::OpenID>, which is not a part of Apache2::Controller
but should work for you anyway.

Natively this depends on L<Apache2::Controller::Session::Cookie>
and L<Apache2::Controller::DBI::Connector> being configured
correctly, but you could always subclass this and overload the
methods below to get information from other sources.

If no claimed ID is detected, the user is shown the login
page.  If an error occured, you'll find the L<Net::OpenID::Consumer>
error details in the session under C<< {a2c}{openid}{errtext} >>
and C<< {a2c}{openid}{errcode} >>.

=head2 REDIRECTION OR REDISPATCH?

Whether redirecting or redispatching, stuff has to be saved
in the session, so C<< $r->notes->{a2c}{session_force_save} >>
will be set.

=head3 INTERNAL LOGIN, LOGOUT AND REGISTER PAGES

=head4 RELATIVE URIS - REDISPATCH

If the uris for these pages are relative, not absolute, i.e.
they are handled by the same controller that we're going to
anyway, then it
tries setting the uri and re-dispatching by grabbing the dispatch
class name out of C<< $r->pnotes->{a2c}{dispatch_class} >> and 
instantiating a new dispatch handler object.

(Dispatch can't keep the handler
subref around in pnotes due to circular references, or reliably assume 
that we know at what location in
the C<< PerlInitHandler >> stack the dispatch handler coderef was
stored by Apache, so we just create a new one - this is assured
to be faster than creating an entire new request, which would
do that anyway.)

So in this case, the content for the login, logout, or register pages will
appear even though the browser uri still displays the requested
protected URI.

=head4 ABSOLUTE URIS - REDIRECT

If the uris for the internal pages are absolute, i.e.
they might be handled by a different controller than the
one that was dispatched, a redirect using Location HTTP header
is used.

=head3 EXTERNAL OPENID PAGES

Any time the browser needs to go to an external page (the openid server),
a redirect using a Location: HTTP header is used.

=head2 PRESERVATION OF INITIAL REQUEST

=head3 REQUESTED URI

When it goes to your login, or register page, it 
stashes the user's uri into the session as 
C<< {a2c}{openid}{previous_uri} >>
and should preserve this for the return url.  It uses
C<< $r->construct_url() >> as the trusted root.  

When the user passes the authentication process (C<< $csr->verified_identity >>),
it sets C<< $r->pnotes->{a2c}{openid_logged_in} >> for this request
to let your handler know if you want to display a message like 
"You have successfully logged in" or something.

=head3 GET AND POST VARS

The whole point of OpenID is that the login mechanism is
invisible - as long as the user can claim to own the url,
and the auth server returns a positive response, then the
user's session should continue.

So, this preserves GET parmas and the POST body through the 
login process and the redirect sequence to the OpenID server,
including when the local session times out.  If they come back
after a while and click a submit button, but either their
local session has timed out or their OpenID server session
has timed out through whatever mechanism that uses, then after
they log into OpenID and are redirected back to the protected
area, the GET params and POST body are restored, and it will
do what the user expected when they clicked the submit button.

This behavior
is a feature, so it is enabled by default, but it may not
be expected, so you can turn it off by using the directive
flag C<< A2C_Auth_OpenID_NoPreserveParams >>.

=head1 DIRECTIVES

L<Apache2::Controller::Directives/Apache2::Controller::Auth::OpenID>

=head1 CACHING

If you want to provide a cache for L<Net::OpenID::Consumer>
to pass onto L<URI::Fetch>, subclass this module and implement
a method C<< cache() >> that returns the appropriate cache object.

=head1 CAVEATS

I have heard there are trickier things one can do to ensure the
security of a session based cookie.  This module just implements
a simple association of a user with a session key by storing a flag
and a last-accessed time value in the session hash, nothing fancier.
If you have recommendations, please let me know.

This calls C<< $r->connection->get_remote_host >> and saves it
in the C<< {a2c}{openid} >> section of the session hash.  So if
you don't want it to do DNS lookups, set directive C<< HostNameLookups off >>.

=head1 OVERLOADABLE METHODS

The only method which should be overloaded in your subclass
is C<< get_uname( $openid_url ) >> which returns the username
string that corresponds to the openid url supplied by the cookie.
When overloading, you get the RequestRec in C<< $self->{r} >>.

=head2 get_uname

 my $uname = $self->get_uname($openid_url);

Takes a string which is the supplied openid_url.
You can overload C<< get_uname >> to supply it
by some other means, such as by LDAP.

    my ($self, $openid_url) = @_;

=head2 default_directives 

Calculate and return the hash of directive defaults.

=head2 DESTROY

To save memory and be clean, when the object is destroyed,
the package-space var C<< %params_hash >> is cleared.

C<< process() >> has to populate a package space variable 
C<< %params_hash >>
with the params contents, so we won't create a closure
that includes the request object when we construct the
params subroutine for the cached openid CSR object.  Otherwise,
the CSR keeps a reference to our handler object around,
which contains a reference to the request object, and
then neither the request nor the handler object are 
cleaned up after this handler exits.  (Apparently
Apache doesn't execute DESTROY until the next time it
has to run this handler.  Doesn't quite make sense,
but that's the way it behaved.)

after successful authentication on the return from the auth server.
