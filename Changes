Revision history for Apache2-Controller

1.000.010   2008-12-2

            Detaints directive values. 

            Controller doesn't double-check allowed_methods
            in case your dispatch wants freedom from that.

            Improvements/correction to documentation.

            Session now uses a checkum.  Thanks David Ihern.

            OpenID auth module put on backburner until
            I rewrite it again, I wanted to get this out
            the door with functional session checksum and
            correct documentation.

1.000.001   2008-12-20

            Put CPAN upload in the right directory.  Duh.

1.000.000   2008-12-20
            
            Session now saves only if status < 300, or if 
            notes->{a2c_session_force_save} is set.

            OpenID!  Rockin.  It doesn't preserve post or get vars
            yet from the prior request across the openid redirect cycle,
            but it's good enough to release.  Hurrah!

            Instead of using PerlCleanupHandler to save session and
            commit database, it uses PerlLogHandler while the
            connection is still open.  Otherwise, session untying
            and database commits may not be processed synchronously
            before the next request that depends on those changes.

0.110.000   2008-08-06

            Removing the "RUN_ALL" simulated mode from response handler.
            It's an over-optimization, and A2C:DBI::Connector supports
            a PerlCleanupHandler to rollback uncommitted transactions.
            Now Controller.pm does not return DONE, but sets status
            and returns OK.
            
            Apache2::Controller::DBI::Connector works.  Cool!

0.101.111   2008-07-22T18:01:00
            LAME LAME LAME I hate versions.

0.101.110   2008-07-22T18:00:00
            Oops I see, Version.pm was not in the MANIFEST, no wonder.

0.101.101   2008-07-22T02:30:00
            Version numbers are so strange.

0.4.3   2008-07-21T00:22:00
        Removed ability to limit methods.  Use Apache config for that.
        A2C:SQL::Controller.  untested.   Controller now passes @path_args
        as arguments to method.  Version is now in its own package.
        Some new SQL-related packages that may or may not work.
        Universal use of Apache2::Controller::Directives - no more
        PerlSetVar.  Documentation edits.

0.4.1   2008-07-16T00:16:00
        Changing version number to use 'version' package.
        I had the version number screwed up before.
        The numbers below are actually 0.4.0, 0.3.0 etc.

0.0.4   2008-07-16T00:08:00
        New dispatch method HashTree implements alternative dispatching.
        Various improvements to documentation.  More tests.
        Developed unit test infrastructure.

0.0.3   2008-07-06T00:08:00
        Changed render to always use A2CRenderTemplateDir as INCLUDE_PATH.
        Various and sundry updates.  Trying to get Directives to work.
        Bleah.

0.0.2   2008-07-02T00:08:00
        Woo-hoo!  Rendering and sessions work.  More tests.

0.0.1   2008-06-01T00:00:00
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
